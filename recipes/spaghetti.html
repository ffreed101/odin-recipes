<p>This is a basic spaghetti that anyone with a pot, a stove, and about 7 dollars can make.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 lb. Ground Meat</li>
    <li>Pack of Thin Spaghetti</li>
    <li>Any Spaghetti Sauce of your choosing. Hell, even if you make and can your own you can use it.</li>
    <li>Toppings(Cheese, peppers, seasoning, etc. its really up to you)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Set a pot of water to eventually boil.</li>
    <li>Get a cooking pot or deep pan and start heating it to brown the ground meat.</li>
    <li>Stir Occasionally making sure all the meat gets nice and brown. Feel free to season at this point.</li>
    <li>Once meat is brown, strain the oil in a strainer bowl and return to the pot with sauce.</li>
    <li>Once the water you set starts boiling, pour in your pasta and stir intensively until it returns to a boil.</li>
    <li>Allow your sauce to simmer while checking on the tenderness of the pasta.</li>
    <li>When the pasta is cooked to your desire, pour <strong>MOST</strong> of the water out. The starch in the boiled water keeps the noodles from sticking together.</li>
    <li>Assemble pasta and add toppings. Enjoy!</li>
